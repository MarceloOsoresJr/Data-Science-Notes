Python: Python is one of the most popular languages for data science. It has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch that make it ideal for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.\n\n2. R: R is a language and environment specifically designed for statistical analysis and data visualization. It's widely used in academic and research settings.\n\n3. SQL (Structured Query Language): SQL is used for managing and querying relational databases. It's essential for data retrieval and manipulation when working with structured data.\n\n4. Julia: Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical computing. It's gaining popularity in data science due to its speed and ease of use.\n\n5. Java: While not as commonly used as Python or R for data analysis, Java is still used in certain data-intensive applications, especially in big data processing with tools like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.\n\n6. Scala: Scala is another language used for big data processing and is often chosen alongside Apache Spark for distributed data processing tasks.\n\n7. SAS: SAS (Statistical Analysis System) is a software suite used for advanced analytics, multivariate analysis, and data management. It's commonly used in industries like healthcare and finance.\n\n8. MATLAB: MATLAB is a proprietary numerical computing environment often used in academia and industry for numerical analysis, data visualization, and algorithm development.\n\n9. Ruby: Ruby is used in data science mainly for web scraping and text processing tasks. It's less common for data analysis compared to Python or R.\n\n10. JavaScript: JavaScript, along with libraries like D3.js, is used for data visualization in web-based applications and dashboards.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Some of the commonly used libraries by Data Scientists include:\n1.
